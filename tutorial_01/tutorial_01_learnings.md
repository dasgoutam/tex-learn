1. Always install the distribution first before the editor. As I had already installed Texmaker, I uninstalled it before installing MacTex. But I'm not sure what errors might be encountered if you install the distribution later

2. Start the document with \documentclass[]{article}
   Different classes exist - need to look more into them

3. Two type of line breaks - soft and hard
   For soft break add \\ after your line
   For hard break, leave a line before you start again

4. To make something math, add $ before and after the expression

5. {} inside a math expression makes it appear in the same line

6. add an additional $ (so $$) before and after expressions to make them appear in a new line
